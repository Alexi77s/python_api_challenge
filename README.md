# python_api_challenge
Made api call to retrieve data and analyze for weather and hotels near the location. Plots were created to show the relationship between latitude vs temperature, latitude vs humidity, latitude vs cloudiness, and latitude vs wind speed. Also, computed linear regressin for each relationship. The Geoapify API was used to locate nearest hotels and  their weather conditions.

I noticed for the VacationPy.ipynb that the map displays did not come out so I will take another look.
